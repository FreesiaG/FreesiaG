Hello, my name is Freesia Gaul. 

This is my GitHub. (I had another, but I'm migrating.) I'm a Quantum Engineering (Honours) student at UNSW, and am highly interested in areas such as machine learning and quantum computing. I am also a keen hobbiest for whatever looks fun!

Right now, I'm working on a ML project for classifying different types of welding defects!
