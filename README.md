Hello, my name is Freesia Gaul!
I'm a Quantum Engineering (Honours) student at UNSW. <br>
This is my professional GitHub page (i've just recently become active on here. <br>
I'm planning to store past challenges and work mainly from quantum-based corners going into the future. <br> <br>

I am highly interested in areas such as machine learning and quantum computing. <br> 
I am also a keen hobbiest for whatever looks fun! 
<br> <br>
Right now, I'm working on a QML project for classifying different types of welding defects, and spinning up a site for the UNSW Rollerblading society!
<br> (I'm also keen on becoming a Qiskit Advocate!)
