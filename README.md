Hello, my name is Freesia Gaul. I'm a Quantum Engineering (Honours) student at UNSW. <br>
This is my professional GitHub page, where I store past challenges and work mainly from quantum-based corners.

I am highly interested in areas such as machine learning and quantum computing. <br> 
I am also a keen hobbiest for whatever looks fun! 
<br> <br>
Right now, I'm working on a QML project for classifying different types of welding defects!
